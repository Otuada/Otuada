         <h1> What does samba represent?</h1>
         <p>Samba is considered by many to be a typically Brazilian musical 
            genre. As it involves music and dance, it is seen as one of the 
            elements that most represent the country's popular culture.

            Its rhythm is a consequence of the miscegenation between African
             and European music that took place both in urban and rural areas..</p>
